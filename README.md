# A Suite of Advanced Tutorials for the GROMOS Biomolecular Simulation Software

This repository contains a collection of files accompanying the suite of GROMOS tutorials 
described in a [LiveCoMS](https://www.livecomsjournal.org/) 
publication. The final pdf version of the manuscript can be found in the 
[releases](https://github.com/hansenniels/gromos_tutorial_livecoms/tree/master/releases) 
directory. The corresponding source files are located in 
[revised\_MS](https://github.com/hansenniels/gromos_tutorial_livecoms/tree/master/review_process/revised_MS)
Each subdirectory in the directory 
[tutorial\_files](https://github.com/hansenniels/gromos_tutorial_livecoms/tree/master/tutorial_files) 
contains all files necessary 
for completing each of the three tutorials. The tutorials are designed for users with some experience 
in the application of molecular dynamics simulations. Therefore, we suggest to 
carry out the basic tutorial first, that is available on www.gromos.net after registration.

# A Suite of Advanced Tutorials for the GROMOS Biomolecular Simulation Software

This repository contains a collection of files accompanying the suite of GROMOS tutorials 
described in a LiveCoMS publication. Each subdirectory in the directory 
[tutorial\_files](https://github.com/hansenniels/gromos_tutorial_livecoms/tree/master/tutorial_files) 
contains all files necessary 
for completing that tutorial. The tutorials are designed for users withh some experience 
in the application of molecular dynamics simulations. Therefore, we suggest to 
carry out the basic tutorial first, that is availaable on www.gromos.net after registration.

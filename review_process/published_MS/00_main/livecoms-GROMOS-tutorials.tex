\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This tutorial describes the practical use of some recent methodological advances implemented in the GROMOS software for biomolecular simulations. It is envisioned as a living document, with additional tutorials being added in the course of time. Currently, it consists of three distinct tutorials. The first tutorial describes the use of time-averaged restraints to enforce agreement with order parameters derived from NMR experiments. The second tutorial describes the use of extended thermodynamic integration in the double-decoupling method to compute the affinity of a small molecule to a protein. The molecule involved bears a negative charge, necessitating the application of post-simulation corrections. The third tutorial is based on the same molecular system, but computes the binding free energy from a path-sampling method with distance-field distance restraints and Hamiltonian replica exchange simulations. The tutorials are written for users with some experience in the application of molecular dynamics simulations. 

%This particular document provides a skeleton illustrating key sections for a Tutorial document.
%Please see the sample \texttt{sample-document.tex} in \url{github.com/livecomsjournal/article_templates/templates} for additional information on and examples of using the LiveCoMS LaTeX class.
%Here we also assume familiarity with LaTeX and knowledge of how to include figures, tables, etc.; if you want examples, see the sample just referenced.
%
%In your work, in this particular slot, please provide an abstract of no more than 250 words.
%Your abstract should explain the main contributions of your article, and should not contain any material that is not included in the main text.
%Please note that your abstract, plus the authorship material following it, must not extend beyond the title page or modifications to the LaTeX class will likely be needed.

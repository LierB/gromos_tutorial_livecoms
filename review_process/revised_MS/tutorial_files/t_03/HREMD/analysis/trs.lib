SPECIALTRJ
# block definition for the special trajectory file.
# which is specified by the input flag trs of program trs_ana.
#
# Use keyword 'block' to specify the blocks
#             'subblock' to specify name and dimensions of a set of data
#             'size' to specify a size that should be read in from the file
#                    this size can be used as dimension specification
#                    in a subblock definition. Using the prefix 'matrix_'
#                    with such a definition will expand the size N to
#                    N*(N+1)/2
#
# Following is the definition for a gromosXX special trajectory
#
  block TIMESTEP
    subblock TIME 2 1
  block DISFIELDRESDATA
    subblock DF 2 1

VARIABLES
# Here you can define variables to be calculated by the program ene_ana
# In principal the program refers to the blocknames you have defined above,
# accessing individual element using array indices (one- or two-dimensional)
#
# Predefined as well is the Boltzmann constant (as BOLTZ = 0.00831441) and
# the MASS which (if not present in the energy trajectory) will be calculated
# from the topology (if inputflag @topo is given).
#
# Additional properties can be defined here as a direct mapping of a known 
# property or as an expression of such properties. Make sure that variables
# and operators are always seperated by spaces. Multi-line expressions are
# allowed.
#
# Examples that work with the standard gromos96 definition are
#          given below and are actually standardly define if no library
#          file is specified.

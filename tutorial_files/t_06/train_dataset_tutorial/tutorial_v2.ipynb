    "# BuRNN tutorial: Preparing of the training dataset and NN model training\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, methanol in water is used as the model system. In the context of BuRNN, we will have methanol in the inner region, while water molecules in the 0.5 nm radius around the methanol will form the buffer region. The rest of the box will be the outer region. The focus of the tutorial will be the generation of the training data set and the training of the neural network (NN) model.\n",

    "### Building ASE database\n",
    "Our QM data needs to be stored in the [ASE databse](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/db/db.html) to be read by SchNetPack (the software we are going to use to train the NN model).In the following part of the tutorial we will build ASE database from our training snapshots, then the database will be used for NN model training. For that purpose we will use in-house made module additional_spk_utils. Firstly, we will need additional_spk_utils.Build_AseDb_From_Mopac_Aux class to create an ASE database. The class takes the following arguments:\n",
    "- complex_path = path to the mopac output files with the whole QM regions (inner + buffer regions, in our case MOPAC_results/minimization/buffer_pls_inner/aux_out)\n",
    "- buffer_path = path to the mopac output files with the buffer regions (in our case MOPAC_results/minimization/buffer/aux_out)\n",
    "- inner_region_size = number of atoms in the inner region\n",
    "- db_name = name of the resulting ASE dataset\n",
    "- db_properties = The properties which will be stored in the database (in our case: complex energy, buffer energy, energy (to be predicted), forces). Energy and forces are mandatory for the BuRNN approach\n",
    "- metadata = metadata\n",
    "- reference_energies = reference energies (energies in vacuum) for all the components in the QM region.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Energy Normalization\n",
    "Here it is good time to describe the last argument reference_energies more in detail. As was mentioned above, in the BuRNN approach we use NN model to predict interaction energy between inner and buffer region in stead of the absolute energy (see [original BuRNN paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpclett.2c00654)). The reference energies are used to calculate the interaction energy. Now consider the example. We have inner + buffer region composed of Methanol (inner region) and 15 water molecules (buffer region). Interaction energy is calculate in the following way:\n",
    "- The absolute energies for inner + buffer regions and buffer regions were calculated by MOPAC.\n",
    "- The first number in reference_energies argument coresponds to the energy of Methanol in vacuum, whereas the second represents the energy of one water molecule in vacuum (both were calculated by MOPAC).\n",
    "- Firstly we sum the energies of the individual components of both regions (inner + buffer and buffer) in vacuum.\n",
    "- for our example the summation is done in the following way:\n",
    "    - inner + buffer region = reference energy of Methanol + 15 * reference energy of water molecule\n",
    "    - buffer region = 15 * reference energy of water molecule\n",
    "- The energies calculetad in the previous step are then subtracted from the original energies calculated MOPAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "What did we get in the last step? We got the interaction energies. For the inner + buffer region we got the interaction energies between methanol and between water molecules themselves. For the buffer region we got the interaction energy between water molecules only. By subtracting these two numbers we obtained the interaction energy between methanol and water molecules (i.e. between the inner and buffer regions). This number is hidden under the name energy in the db_properties argument. A similar procedure is done for the forces. The difference is that in case of forces we are interested in atomic contributions. Therefore, the normalization of the forces is done by subtracting the values for the inner + buffer region and the buffer region. The values for the inner region are passed without subtraction (they are not in the buffer region, so there is nothing to subtract). The subtracted values are hidden behind the name forces in the db_properties argument."
